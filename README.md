# Tetris Game

This is a simple Tetris game written in Java as a school project. The game features the classic Tetris gameplay, where the player must arrange falling blocks to form complete rows and clear them from the screen.

## How to Play

To start the game, simply run the `Window.java` file in your Java IDE or from the command line.

Once the game has started, use the following keys to control the falling blocks:

- Left arrow: Move the block left
- Right arrow: Move the block right
- Up arrow: Rotate the block
- Down arrow: Move the block down faster

The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by clearing rows of blocks. The player earns points for each row cleared, and the game speeds up as the player progresses.

The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the screen.

## Dependencies

The game was written in Java using the Swing library for the graphical user interface. No other external libraries or dependencies are required to run the game.
